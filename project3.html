                agree on one thing: MARTA’s mobile app needs improvement. Over the course of 4 weeks, I redesigned MARTA's app for an overall enhanced experience.

                MARTA’s iOS app presents a bad case of User Experience. The problems affect a large range of users and directly impacts their experience with MARTA not just through the app, but in the real world as well. Particularly, I identified the following as key
                problem points in the MARTA app:

            <ol class="case-study-paragraph">
                <li><span><b>Confusing Information Architecture</b> - information is not presented in a hierarchy that serves user needs.</span></li>

                <li><span><b>Outdated UI</b> - this only enhances the previous issues and causes more confusion for users (double use of icons, confusing color choices, etc.)</span></li>

                Through user research and thorough examination of the existing app, as well as the MARTA system overall, I redesigned an enhanced MARTA app experience that focuses on user needs. Instead of throwing transit information at users, the redesign allows for

            <h3 class="section-subheading ">User Flows</h3>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">I then moved onto creating user flows to map out exactly how a user would navigate the app. When creating these flows, emphasis was placed upon reducing the amount of taps required to locate transit information because users I interviewed
                commented on how this often affected their ability to catch a train or bus on time.

                    I reorganized the navigation of the app and made the nearby feature the first menu item. This solution also ensures a more user-centered app experience. This also supports the finding from the survey that users primarily open the app when they are looking

            <h2 class="main-heading ">Reflection</h2>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">Overall, this project was a good way to improve both the information architecture of an app and interface. I was able to put my UX and UI skills to test on a usability problem I encountered for years before I transitioned into UX. It was satisfying
                to design solutions for these usability issues that bugged me for years but this created another challenge I had to overcome: Seeing beyond my own user bias. For example, I never thought the planning a trip feature would be a useful addition
                to the app, but an overwhelming majority of my participants in my research voiced their need for this feature and it made a lot of sense when I considered the some of the demographics – international students relying on Marta and learning
                their way around town at the same time.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-subheading ">If I had more time</h3>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">There are a lot of things to be incorporated in the future to go beyond the MVP. I would like to be able to conduct in-person research with potential users of the redesigned app. Being able to see how users would navigate the app in different
                environments such as a Marta bus stop or station would give me even more insight on how to possibly make this even better.
