                <p>The current market for cloud storage apps is saturated with products catered towards either business or personal use and as a result, cloud storage for college work quickly becomes unorganized.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Files become easily disorganized and cluttered.</li>
                    <li>Users are using multiple apps to separate schoolwork, personal files, and sometimes work files.</li>
                    <li>Unable to easily save web links for future use.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="happy-face section-subheading">Solution</h3>
                <p>Edubox provides tools to ensure busy college students stay organized alongside basic cloud storage functions such as uploading, sharing, and collaborating on files.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">User Surveys</h3>
                <p>I began my research by first conducting a survey in effort to better understand what college students may currently seek out of a cloud storage service. The questions asked in my survey helped me get to know what really frustrated
                    my
                    users and how to potentially go about solving their frustrations.</p>

                <h4 class="section-titles">Survey Takeaways</h4>
                <p>The survey results enabled me to narrow down the target audience for the product. I kept the following in mind for the remainder of the project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users will be comprised of college students.</li>
                    <li>Emphasize organization tools.</li>
                    <li>Provide collaboration tools.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>To begin clarifying my client‚Äôs request for the cloud storage app, I began by analyzing current cloud storage apps in the market. I narrowed down my analysis to three major players in the market: Google Drive, Dropbox and
                    Evernote.</p>
                <div class="info-rectangle comp-analysis">
                    <div class="dropbox">
                        <img src="images/dropbox.svg" alt="Dropbox" />
                        <h4 class="competitor-names">Dropbox</h4>
                        <p class="competitive-desc">‚úÖ Accessibility across devices</br>
                            üëé Target audience: professionals</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="googledrive">
                        <img src="images/googledrive.svg" alt="Google Drive" />
                        <h4 class="competitor-names">Google Drive</h4>
                        <p class="competitive-desc">‚úÖ Content creation</br>
                            üëé Not targeted for students</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="evernote">
                        <img src="images/evernote.svg" alt="Evernote" />
                        <h4 class="competitor-names">Google Drive</h4>
                        <p class="competitive-desc">‚úÖ Content creation for students</br>
                            üëé Absence of standard cloud storage features</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>In analyzing these three competitors, I discovered ways in which my product could differentiate itself in this market:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear organization through categorization.</li>
                        <li>Creation of web links for future use.</li>
                        <li>Reduction of clicks to acheive a specific task.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading">User Personas</h3>
                    <p>With the user research I had at this point, I was able to construct personas representative of the users Edubox would cater to:</p>
                    <div class="persona1">

                            <li>Create text documents for class notes within the cloud.</li>
                            <li>Easily access recently added files.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="persona-heading">Frustrations</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Difficult to find specific files.</li>
                            <li>Unable to easily create notes for class.</li>

                            <li>Create text documents and collaborate with other graduate students on research papers.</li>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">User Stories</h3>
                <p>With the results of my survey and user personas, I was able to analyze this information and create user stories. The user stories were prioritized from low to high importance, and the user stories with highest importance were
                    prioritized when creating Edubox. Below are some of the high priority user stories that I needed to incorporate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to easily add new content such as text documents and weblinks.</li>
                    <li>I want to easily organize files or folders.</li>
                    <li>I want to share links to files or folders with others.</li>
                </ul>
                <a class="button" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uhcxXo5XOMYXuRLA6s-ZXxeOgHpwAi_zsw2ksG22wB0/edit?usp=sharing">User Stories</a>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">User Flows</h3>
                <p>Upon completing the user stories, it became easier to see exactly what tasks users wanted to complete in Edubox. It was now time to think about how exactly these tasks would be performed within Edubox. I asked myself questions
                    such as, ‚Äúis this dialog box truly necessary here?‚Äù and ‚Äúcould this step be combined in the previous pop-up?‚Äù. Asking myself these questions helped me prepare for future testing and enabled me to think out solutions for
                    simplified and seamless user flows. Below are some user flows I created in this process:</p>
                <img src="images/flow1.png" alt="User Flow" />

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Wireframes</h3>
                <p>After organizing how users would seamlessly flow throughout tasks in Edubox, it was time to put these designed flows to test. I started by sketching and designing what the user flows would actually look like on a screen.</p>

                <p>To begin testing the usability of Edubox thus far, I created a prototype of the wireframes I had created. The usability testing revealed the following that required further analysis and resulted in some redesigns:</p>
                <h4 class="section-titles">Change #1</h4>
                <img src="images/ut-change1.png" alt="Change 1" />
                <p>Users were confused when asked to ‚Äúadd content‚Äù and upload content.</p>

                <p>At this state in the process, the skeletal structure of Edubox was complete and the purpose of the product was clear. The next step was to reinforce the purpose of Edubox with branding work. I began the branding process by first
                    creating a mind map and sketches for a logo that would communicate to users the features that make Edubox stand out: organization tools to simplify your schoolwork.</p>
                <img src="images/mindmap.png" alt="Mindmap" />
                <p>I began the branding process by first creating a mindmap to flesh out ideas. For the mindmapping, I used words associated with schoolwork and the product features. Since the product is geared toward college students, I focused on
                    friendly branding that would enhance the (often stressed) college student‚Äôs experience when using Edubox. The friendly branding idea was derived through my competitive analysis of Dropbox. In analyzing Dropbox, I noted that the
                    product was pushed towards businesses and the overall branding is very serious.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">High Fidelity Mockups: Version 1</h3>
                <p>Now that I had wireframes, real user testing data, and branding to work with, I began designing high fidelity mockups. I began by using the initial colors I had chosen for the brand, however this would change later down the line
                    with the help of feedback from other designers and user testing.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†<div class="col">

                    ¬†</div>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">High Fidelity Mockups: Version 2</h3>
                <p>I gained valuable feedback from another designer in the process of designing my mockups. For example, my initial mockups incorporated a great deal of a particular color, #05C9C2, the designer noted that this color choice was not
                    the best in terms of accessibility. For example, it was revealed that this color made it harder for users with lowered vision to read the white text when this color was used in buttons. As much as I personally found this color to
                    be pleasing, the user is always right. Thus, I made changes to my mockups. I opted for a different color, #2869E1. This color passed accessibility testing and was also derived from the Edubox logo.</p>

                <p class="photo-caption">Modals and buttons utilizing the new color - accessibility is key!</p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Usability Testing: Round 2</h3>
                <p>With a working high fidelity prototype, it was time to test users again. My second round of testing revealed the following to be updated in my design:</p>
                <h4 class="section-titles">Change #1:</h4>
                <img src="images/ut2-change1before.png" alt="Before" />
                <p>When users were asked to sort documents by ‚Äúfile type‚Äù, there was some confusion on where to click in order to perform this action:</p>
                <img src="images/ut2-change1after.png" alt="After" />
                <p>The text ‚ÄúSort by:‚Äù was added beside the drop down menu. Further testing revealed that this was a successful solution to the problem.</p>
                <h4 class="section-titles">Change #2:</h4>
                <p>Testing also revealed that users were better able to navigate Edubox when a breadcrumb navigation was provided than when it was not. For example, users were confused on how to go back to the Dashboard from the documents page.
                    Thus, simply clicking on the logo on the top left-hand corner of the screen to go back to the Dashboard was not intuitive.</p>
                <img src="images/ut2-change2before.png" alt="Before" />
                <p class="photo-caption">Screen without the breadcrumb navigation</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Finishing Touches: A/B Testing</h3>
                <p>At this stage in the process, it was time to clean up the visual design even further. The best way to do this was to perform A/B Testing of design elements on people.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The process of creating Edubox was both exhilarating and challenging. I encountered my first challenge at the start of the process when trying to narrow down a viable product based on the client‚Äôs proposal. At first, this
                            was
                            a
                            difficult prospect as the proposal was quite vague, however the user research I performed directly after this was extremely helpful in generating an idea for a unique product. This brings me to my next challenge: the
                            existing
                            market. Performing the competitive analysis for Edubox was initially daunting when realizing you are competing with big names like Google. Nevertheless, the challenge became exciting when analyzing the existing products
                            and
                            realizing all the potential improvements that could be made, which I would end up incorporating into Edubox. This was propelled further with the additional features I added to Edubox based on user research. I was
                            genuinely
                            surprised in realizing how these already well-established products could be drastically improved. Something that did not work when creating this project was personal biases when it came to color choice.</p>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading">Lesson learned</h3>
                        <p>As previously noted, the visually appealing color I chose at the beginning of this project simply did not work when it came to accessibility. However, I learned to accept this and quickly move on for the sake of time.
                            Having
                            to
                            change the color also helped me accept criticism, especially when it is backed by research. I also realized the importance of accessibility over designs that look pretty but may not be accessible to all.</p>
                        <h3 class="section-subheading">If I had more time...</h3>
                        <p>Another valuable lesson I learned from designing Edubox was the importance of user testing. User testing revealed to me issues that I simply overlooked myself. In the future, I will certainly use this experience I gained
                            by
                            putting more emphasis on critiques and performing even more user tests. This brings me to my final point: If I had more time, I would have performed a greater variety of user testing on a larger sample. The more data, the
                            more
                            accurately you can incorporate user feedback into making the best possible product.</p>
