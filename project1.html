                <h3 class="sad-face section-subheading">Problem</h3>
                <p>The current market for cloud storage apps is saturated with products catered towards either business or personal use and as a result, cloud storage for college work quickly becomes unorganized.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Files become easily disorganized and cluttered.</li>
                    <li>Users are using multiple apps to separate schoolwork, personal files, and sometimes work files.</li>
                    <li>Unable to easily save web links for future use.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="happy-face section-subheading">Solution</h3>
                <p>Edubox provides tools to ensure busy college students stay organized alongside basic cloud storage functions such as uploading, sharing, and collaborating on files.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organization tools to keep files and folders from becoming cluttered.</li>
                    <li>Ability to categorize things for either school, work, or personal use.</li>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">User Surveys</h3>
                <p>I began my research by first conducting a survey in effort to better understand what college students may currently seek out of a cloud storage service. The questions asked in my survey helped me get to know what really frustrated
                    my
                    users and how to potentially go about solving their frustrations.</p>

                <h4 class="section-titles">Survey Takeaways</h4>
                <p>The survey results enabled me to narrow down the target audience for the product. I kept the following in mind for the remainder of the project:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users will be comprised of college students.</li>
                    <li>Emphasize organization tools.</li>
                    <li>Provide collaboration tools.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>To begin clarifying my client’s request for the cloud storage app, I began by analyzing current cloud storage apps in the market. I narrowed down my analysis to three major players in the market: Google Drive, Dropbox and
                    Evernote.</p>
                <div class="info-rectangle comp-analysis">
                    <div class="dropbox">
                        <img src="images/dropbox.svg" alt="Dropbox"></img>
                        <h4 class="competitor-names">Dropbox</h4>
                        <p class="competitive-desc">✅ Accessibility across devices</br>
                            👎 Target audience: professionals</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="googledrive">
                        <img src="images/googledrive.svg" alt="Google Drive"></img>
                        <h4 class="competitor-names">Google Drive</h4>
                        <p class="competitive-desc">✅ Content creation</br>
                            👎 Not targeted for students</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="evernote">
                        <img src="images/evernote.svg" alt="Evernote"></img>
                        <h4 class="competitor-names">Google Drive</h4>
                        <p class="competitive-desc">✅ Content creation for students</br>
                            👎 Absence of standard cloud storage features</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>In analyzing these three competitors, I discovered ways in which my product could differentiate itself in this market:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clear organization through categorization.</li>
                        <li>Creation of web links for future use.</li>
                        <li>Reduction of clicks to acheive a specific task.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading">User Personas</h3>
                    <p>With the user research I had at this point, I was able to construct personas representative of the users Edubox would cater to:</p>
                    <div class="persona1">

                            <li>Have files organized by classes.</li>
                            <li>Create text documents for class notes within the cloud.</li>
                            <li>Easily access recently added files.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="persona-heading">Frustrations</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Difficult to find specific files.</li>
                            <li>Unable to easily create notes for class.</li>
                            <li>Can’t tell for what class a file is for.</li>

                            <li>Better organization of files.</li>
                            <li>Create text documents and collaborate with other graduate students on research papers.</li>
                            <li>Easily save links to articles.</li>

                        <h5 class="persona-heading">Frustrations</h5>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Collaboration features are confusing.</li>
                            <li>Too many menu options to sift through just to perform a specific task.</li>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Information Architecture</h2>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">User Stories</h3>
                <p>With the results of my survey and user personas, I was able to analyze this information and create user stories. The user stories were prioritized from low to high importance, and the user stories with highest importance were
                    prioritized when creating Edubox. Below are some of the high priority user stories that I needed to incorporate:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I want to easily add new content such as text documents and weblinks.</li>
                    <li>I want to easily organize files or folders.</li>
                    <li>I want to share links to files or folders with others.</li>
                </ul>
                <a class="button" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uhcxXo5XOMYXuRLA6s-ZXxeOgHpwAi_zsw2ksG22wB0/edit?usp=sharing">User Stories</a>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">User Flows</h3>
                <p>Upon completing the user stories, it became easier to see exactly what tasks users wanted to complete in Edubox. It was now time to think about how exactly these tasks would be performed within Edubox. I asked myself questions
                    such as, “is this dialog box truly necessary here?” and “could this step be combined in the previous pop-up?”. Asking myself these questions helped me prepare for future testing and enabled me to think out solutions for
                    simplified and seamless user flows. Below are some user flows I created in this process:</p>

                <p class="photo-caption">“I want to share links to files or folders with others”</p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading">Wireframes</h3>
                <p>After organizing how users would seamlessly flow throughout tasks in Edubox, it was time to put these designed flows to test. I started by sketching and designing what the user flows would actually look like on a screen.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Usability Testing: Round 1</h3>
                <p>To begin testing the usability of Edubox thus far, I created a prototype of the wireframes I had created. The usability testing revealed the following that required further analysis and resulted in some redesigns:</p>
