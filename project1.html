            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                Upon completing the user stories, it became easier to see exactly what tasks users wanted to complete in Edubox. It was now time to think about how exactly these tasks would be performed within Edubox. I asked myself questions such as, “is this dialog
                box truly necessary here?” and “could this step be combined in the previous pop-up?”. Asking myself these questions helped me prepare for future testing and enabled me to think out solutions for simplified and seamless user flows. Below
                are some user flows I created in this process:

            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                To begin testing the usability of Edubox thus far, I created a prototype of the wireframes I had created. The usability testing revealed the following that required further analysis and resulted in some redesigns:

            <h4 class="section-titles ">Building a brand identity</h4>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                At this state in the process, the skeletal structure of Edubox was complete and the purpose of the product was clear. The next step was to reinforce the purpose of Edubox with branding work. I began the branding process by first creating a mind map and
                sketches for a logo that would communicate to users the features that make Edubox stand out: organization tools to simplify your schoolwork.
            </p>


            <img class="mindmap " src="images/mindmap.png " alt="Mindmap " />
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                I began the branding process by first creating a mindmap to flesh out ideas. For the mindmapping, I used words associated with schoolwork and the product features. Since the product is geared toward college students, I focused on friendly branding that
                would enhance the (often stressed) college student’s experience when using Edubox. The friendly branding idea was derived through my competitive analysis of Dropbox. In analyzing Dropbox, I noted that the product was pushed towards businesses
                and the overall branding is very serious.

            </div>

            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                For the Edubox logo, I ended up choosing a sketch that incorporated a smiley face to further evoke the friendliness of the app.

            <p class="case-study-paragraph visual-section2 ">
                The final color palette was based on the emotions Edubox should convey to users such as trustworthiness and calmness. Accessibility was also a top priority in the finalized color palette.

                <br>
                <br>
                <br> Nunito (bold) was chosen as the main font in an effort to achieve the friendly and welcoming nature of the app. Montserrat was chosen as the complimentary font that provides contrast to main font and is legible.

            <h3 class="section-subheading ">High Fidelity Mockups: Version 1</h3>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                Now that I had wireframes, real user testing data, and branding to work with, I began designing high fidelity mockups. I began by using the initial colors I had chosen for the brand, however this would change later down the line with the help of feedback
                from other designers and user testing.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-subheading ">High Fidelity Mockups: Version 2</h3>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                I gained valuable feedback from another designer in the process of designing my mockups. For example, my initial mockups incorporated a great deal of a particular color, #05C9C2, the designer noted that this color choice was not the best in terms of accessibility.
                For example, <span class="highlight-edubox ">it was revealed that this color made it harder for users with lowered vision to read the white text when this color was used in buttons. As much as I personally found this color to be pleasing, the user is always right. Thus,
            I made changes to my mockups. I opted for a different color, #2869E1.</span> This color passed accessibility testing and was also derived from the Edubox logo.

            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                With a working high fidelity prototype, it was time to test users again. My second round of testing revealed the following to be updated in my design:
            </p>
            <h4 class="section-titles ">Change #1:</h4>
            <img class="ut2 " src="images/ut2-change1before.png " alt="Before " />
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                When users were asked to sort documents by “file type”, there was some confusion on where to click in order to perform this action:
            </p>
            <img class="ut2 " src="images/ut2-change1after.png " alt="After " />
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                The text “Sort by:” was added beside the drop down menu. Further testing revealed that this was a successful solution to the problem.
            </p>
            <h4 class="section-titles ">Change #2:</h4>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                Testing also revealed that users were better able to navigate Edubox when a breadcrumb navigation was provided than when it was not. For example, users were confused on how to go back to the Dashboard from the documents page. Thus, simply clicking on
                the logo on the top left-hand corner of the screen to go back to the Dashboard was not intuitive.

                <!--conclusion-->
                <h2 class="main-heading ">Reflection</h2>
                <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                    The process of creating Edubox was both exhilarating and challenging. I encountered my first challenge at the start of the process when trying to narrow down a viable product based on the client’s proposal. At first, this was a difficult prospect as the
                    proposal was quite vague, however the user research I performed directly after this was extremely helpful in generating an idea for a unique product. This brings me to my next challenge: the existing market. Performing the competitive
                    analysis for Edubox was initially daunting when realizing you are competing with big names like Google. Nevertheless, the challenge became exciting when analyzing the existing products and realizing all the potential improvements that
                    could be made, which I would end up incorporating into Edubox. This was propelled further with the additional features I added to Edubox based on user research. I was genuinely surprised in realizing how these already well-established
                    products could be drastically improved. Something that did not work when creating this project was personal biases when it came to color choice.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading ">Lesson learned</h3>
                <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                    As previously noted, the visually appealing color I chose at the beginning of this project simply did not work when it came to accessibility. However, I learned to accept this and quickly move on for the sake of time. Having to change the color also helped
                    me accept criticism, especially when it is backed by research. I also realized the importance of accessibility over designs that look pretty but may not be accessible to all.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subheading ">If I had more time...</h3>
                <p class="case-study-paragraph ">
                    Another valuable lesson I learned from designing Edubox was the importance of user testing. User testing revealed to me issues that I simply overlooked myself. In the future, I will certainly use this experience I gained by putting more emphasis on critiques
                    and performing even more user tests. This brings me to my final point: If I had more time, I would have performed a greater variety of user testing on a larger sample. The more data, the more accurately you can incorporate user feedback
                    into making the best possible product.
