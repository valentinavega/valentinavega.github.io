        <h3 class="section-subheading">Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            To begin clarifying my client‚Äôs request for the cloud storage app, I began by analyzing current cloud storage apps in the market. I narrowed down my analysis to three major players in the market: Google Drive, Dropbox and Evernote.
        </p>

        <div class="info-rectangle comp-analysis">
            <div class="dropbox">

                <p class="competitive-desc">

                <p class="competitive-desc">

                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            In analyzing these three competitors, I discovered ways in which my product could differentiate itself in this market:
        </p>
        <ol class="case-study-paragraph">
            <li>Clear organization through categorization.</li>
            <li>Creation of web links for future use.</li>

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            With the results of my survey and user personas, I was able to analyze this information and create user stories. The user stories were prioritized from low to high importance, and the user stories with highest importance were prioritized when creating
            Edubox. Below are some of the high priority user stories that I needed to incorporate:

        <h3 class="section-subheading">User Flows</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            Upon completing the user stories, it became easier to see exactly what tasks users wanted to complete in Edubox. It was now time to think about how exactly these tasks would be performed within Edubox. I asked myself questions such as, ‚Äúis this dialog
            box truly necessary here?‚Äù and ‚Äúcould this step be combined in the previous pop-up?‚Äù. Asking myself these questions helped me prepare for future testing and enabled me to think out solutions for simplified and seamless user flows. Below are
            some user flows I created in this process:

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            At this state in the process, the skeletal structure of Edubox was complete and the purpose of the product was clear. The next step was to reinforce the purpose of Edubox with branding work. I began the branding process by first creating a mind map and
            sketches for a logo that would communicate to users the features that make Edubox stand out: organization tools to simplify your schoolwork.

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            I began the branding process by first creating a mindmap to flesh out ideas. For the mindmapping, I used words associated with schoolwork and the product features. Since the product is geared toward college students, I focused on friendly branding that
            would enhance the (often stressed) college student‚Äôs experience when using Edubox. The friendly branding idea was derived through my competitive analysis of Dropbox. In analyzing Dropbox, I noted that the product was pushed towards businesses
            and the overall branding is very serious.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">High Fidelity Mockups: Version 1</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            Now that I had wireframes, real user testing data, and branding to work with, I began designing high fidelity mockups. I began by using the initial colors I had chosen for the brand, however this would change later down the line with the help of feedback
            from other designers and user testing.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">High Fidelity Mockups: Version 2</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            I gained valuable feedback from another designer in the process of designing my mockups. For example, my initial mockups incorporated a great deal of a particular color, #05C9C2, the designer noted that this color choice was not the best in terms of accessibility.
            For example, it was revealed that this color made it harder for users with lowered vision to read the white text when this color was used in buttons. As much as I personally found this color to be pleasing, the user is always right. Thus,
            I made changes to my mockups. I opted for a different color, #2869E1. This color passed accessibility testing and was also derived from the Edubox logo.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Usability Testing: Round 2</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            With a working high fidelity prototype, it was time to test users again. My second round of testing revealed the following to be updated in my design:

        <h4 class="section-titles">Change #1:</h4>
        <img class="w-60" src="images/ut2-change1before.png" alt="Before" />
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            When users were asked to sort documents by ‚Äúfile type‚Äù, there was some confusion on where to click in order to perform this action:
        </p>
        <img class="w-60" src="images/ut2-change1after.png" alt="After" />
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            The text ‚ÄúSort by:‚Äù was added beside the drop down menu. Further testing revealed that this was a successful solution to the problem.
        </p>
        <h4 class="section-titles">Change #2:</h4>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            Testing also revealed that users were better able to navigate Edubox when a breadcrumb navigation was provided than when it was not. For example, users were confused on how to go back to the Dashboard from the documents page. Thus, simply clicking on
            the logo on the top left-hand corner of the screen to go back to the Dashboard was not intuitive.

        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            At this stage in the process, it was time to clean up the visual design even further. The best way to do this was to perform A/B Testing of design elements on people.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            The process of creating Edubox was both exhilarating and challenging. I encountered my first challenge at the start of the process when trying to narrow down a viable product based on the client‚Äôs proposal. At first, this was a difficult prospect as the
            proposal was quite vague, however the user research I performed directly after this was extremely helpful in generating an idea for a unique product. This brings me to my next challenge: the existing market. Performing the competitive analysis
            for Edubox was initially daunting when realizing you are competing with big names like Google. Nevertheless, the challenge became exciting when analyzing the existing products and realizing all the potential improvements that could be made,
            which I would end up incorporating into Edubox. This was propelled further with the additional features I added to Edubox based on user research. I was genuinely surprised in realizing how these already well-established products could be drastically
            improved. Something that did not work when creating this project was personal biases when it came to color choice.
        </p>
        <h3 class="conclusion-subheading">Lesson learned</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            As previously noted, the visually appealing color I chose at the beginning of this project simply did not work when it came to accessibility. However, I learned to accept this and quickly move on for the sake of time. Having to change the color also helped
            me accept criticism, especially when it is backed by research. I also realized the importance of accessibility over designs that look pretty but may not be accessible to all.
        </p>
        <h3 class="conclusion-subheading">If I had more time...</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">
            Another valuable lesson I learned from designing Edubox was the importance of user testing. User testing revealed to me issues that I simply overlooked myself. In the future, I will certainly use this experience I gained by putting more emphasis on critiques
            and performing even more user tests. This brings me to my final point: If I had more time, I would have performed a greater variety of user testing on a larger sample. The more data, the more accurately you can incorporate user feedback into
            making the best possible product.
