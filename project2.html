            At this point of the process we knew we wanted the app to combine socializing and music, but the exact features were unknown. In an effort to create the MVP, we conducted user research. We began with a survey to examine the relationship between general public and their interest in music and socialization We asked about information they might be interested in sharing and seeing from regarding music streaming. We also asked questions about how they currently discover music and how they interested they were in possibly improving this process.

We created a prototype utilizing Maze which allowed us to test key features early on in the design process.

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Branding</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">To give life to the wireframes with visual design, the first step was to begin branding for the app. We started with a mind mapping exercise to get a feel for what the app would potentially be. We focused on words such as <strong>music</strong>, <strong>friendship</strong> and <strong>connected</strong>. The mind mapping activity ultimately led to us to choose the name “MusicLink” for the app.

        <h4 class="musiclink-section-titles">Logo & Color Palette</h4>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">The logo sketches and digital renditions utilized concepts explored in the mind mapping exercise. The final logo incorporates the shape of the letter “M” with the ends representing music notes.</p>
        <img class="mindmapping" src="images/musiclink-logo-design.png " alt="Logo Designing " />
        <p class="case-study-paragraph-logo">The first rendition of the logo utilized a color palette that would later be changed. Through advice from other designers, it was suggested that the main color of the app be changed due to it being similar to the color used in Apple Music.</p>
        <img class="mindmapping" src="images/musiclink-logo-changes.png " alt="Logo Designing " />
        <h4 class="musiclink-section-titles">Establishing a Design System</h4>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">In an effort to keep designs consistent across different screens, we established a small design system. Using Figma's color styles, text styles, and assets features made it easier to establish a cohesive system and simplified the overall design process. This was especially valuable when having to make overall edits to designs based on user testing.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">Usability Testing: Round 2</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">With visuals and a small design system incorporated into the wireframes that were iterated upon after user testing, it was time to conduct further usability testing. Remote testing and another Maze test were completed in order to test out the usability of the app.</p>
        <h4 class="musiclink-hifi-titles">Task 1: Sharing a playlist from user profile</h4>
        <div class="lofi-maze">
            <img class="maze" src="images/musiclink-maze-2.png" alt="Maze results " />
            <p class="maze-paragraph" data-aos="fade-left">Maze testing revealed a 83% misclick rate, meaning users were very confused as to where to click to open the menu that would enable them to share a playlist. Users that asked to complete this task via the Zoom testing exhibited the same confusion on this screen.</p>
        </div>
        <img class="usability-2" src="images/musiclink-maze-ut1.png " alt="Usability changes " />
        <ol class="usability-changes" data-aos="fade-up">
            <li class="changes">Maze testing revealed that users thought the “edit profile” button meant to share or make a post, so this was changed to a button that distinctly reads “edit profile”.</li>
            <li class="changes">Users were confused by the prototype where it referred to “Max” on the user profile, so the wording was changed to “Your playlists” for an experience centered around the user.</li>
            <li class="changes">The playlist cards were edited to include the last time they were played and the icon to open the menu, where users would select to share the playlist, was moved and made into a clearer call to action.</li>
            <li class="changes">With further discussion with other designers, we came to the agreement that this screen felt stark and distinct from the rest of the app. Changes in the overall UI were implemented for an overall cleaner look that followed the design system previously established.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4 class="musiclink-hifi-titles">Task 2: Creating a playlist</h4>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">When completing this task, some users commented on this flow being unnecessarily long. To shorten and simplify the flow a user would take to create a new playlist, the CTA for creating a new playlist was moved up to the first screen in the flow. In addition to simplifying this flow, it made sense to move this CTA here because this screen felt bare before and simply served as a navigational screen.</p>
        <div class="musiclink-mockup-solutions-container">
                    <div class="musiclink-mockup-solution">
                    <p class="solution-caption">Initial flow</p>
                    <video controls=""><source src="images/musiclink-playlist-1.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

                    </div>
            </div>


            <h4 class="musiclink-hifi-titles">Task 3: Visiting friend's profile via the home feed</h4>
            <p class="case-study-paragraph">User testing revealed that users found the card system showing what friends were listening to on the home feed to be confusing when trying to click on certain things. Particularly, users found it confusing if they wanted to click on the fried's profile rather than the song they are listening to, and vice versa.</p>

                </div>
                <ol class="usability-changes" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <li class="changes">Friend information and music information were ungrouped.</li>
                    <li class="changes">More space alotted to the song the friend is listening because this is the most pertinent information for this section.</li>
                </ol>

            <h4 class="musiclink-hifi-titles">Task 4: Finding local music events to attend</h4>
            <div class="lofi-maze">
                <img class="maze" src="images/musiclink-maze-3.png" alt="Maze results " />
                <p class="maze-paragraph" data-aos="fade-left">Testing revealed that users found it confusing to begin browsing local music events. Maze testing showed that some users clicked on the "discover" icon on the tab bar rather than the "local" tab on the segmented navigation of the homepage.</p>
            </div>

            <img class="usability-2" src="images/musiclink-maze-ut2.png " alt="Usability changes " />
            <ol class="usability-changes" data-aos="fade-up">
                <li class="changes">The "local" tab was renamed to "events".</li>
                <li class="changes">A search function was added to this screen because users would ideally want to look for events in other locations, especially if they are travelling.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3 class="section-subheading">A/B Testing for preference regarding UI elements.</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">To further touch up the UI elements of the app, A/B testing on potential users and designers was conducted. The results from this A/B testing session served as a basis for the systemic changes to the UI that were needed to both polish the design and reach the MVP.</p>

        <h2 class="main-heading ">Reflection</h2>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">What worked?</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">The overall structure of the app and design worked well in the beginning stages of the design. Due to the simplicity of the design, users were able to easily locate call to actions and locations in which key pages were held. User testing was also essential for reaching a better design and ultimately led to what features would be included and helped me simplify the user flows and overall user experience.</p>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">What didn't work?</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">The overall onboarding experience felt choppy and abrupt at times. The experience should have been more interactive, but it was difficult to personalize the experience without having the user sign up first.</p>
        <h3 class="section-subheading">If I had more time</h3>
        <p class="case-study-paragraph">If given more time, I would have definitely focused more on the onboarding experience. I would have also spent more time on the design system. Particularly, I had a hard time finding icons for the app in a short amount of time. As a result, some icon choices do not feel cohesive.</p>
